# Apks Releases

This repository is designed to host the APK files for my software projects. Here, you will find the latest versions of my applications available for download, along with previous versions for reference purposes.

To download an APK, simply click on the file you wish to download, then click the "Download" button. You can also clone this repository to your local machine using Git and build the APKs yourself.
